# Encryption_Diary
I created an encryption diary in C language ensuring data confidentiality and protection using Caesar Cipher algorithm.
It was created in C language, no sepcial modules were used for this project. The main features of the project are as follows:
1.There is an authentication system to ensure the data safety of all the users.
2.The data of the users was encrypted using caesar cipher algorithm.
3.There were separate files to handle different types of data for example, different file was created to save the passwords and there was a different file to save the reminders set by the user.
